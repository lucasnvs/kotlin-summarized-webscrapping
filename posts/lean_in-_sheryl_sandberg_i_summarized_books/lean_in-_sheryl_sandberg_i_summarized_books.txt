<h3 style="text-align: left;">Despite developments in how women are treated today, they still get sidelined in many ways</h3> In the United States and other parts of the world, women are slowly and steadily advancing. Women have evolved from being home-makers to taking top positions in the corporate world. It is no longer surprising to see a woman on the board seat, just as it has become quite the norm to have a woman occupy a congressional seat. While there are still some parts of the world where women are treated as toys, slaves, and property, America is centuries ahead of such a biased misplacement of the female gender.
However, men still rule the world. The working world is still a tough place for women. Women are being sidelined in their places of work; there are still some companies that pay women less than their male counterparts. Women occupy only a tiny percentage of the board seats and the Congress is still dominated by men.
The female gender needs to rise up. There is a call for us to wisen up and command more respect in the society
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Women still get cheated out of compensation for labor</h3> It is quite a common anomaly that women get paid less than their male counterparts for the same job. In 1970, American women were paid 59 cents for every dollar their male counterparts made. After lots of protests and hard work, there was a raise to 77% for every dollar men made.
As if indiscrepancies in payment wasn’t enough, women have so much difficulty getting a spot in the corporate world in the first place.
There are 195 independent countries in the world and only 17 are led by women. And of the Fortune 500 CEOs, only 21 are women. There is such a large gap between the male and female gender, and it is even worse for women of color.
While women continue to outpace men in educational achievement, we have ceased making real progress at the top of any industry. This means that when it comes to making the decisions that most affect our world, women’s voices are not heard equally.
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Gender equality is promised but not truly given</h3> In the midst of all the outcries, there is a promise of equality. However, there is a difference between the promise of equality and true equality.
Conditions for all women will improve when there are more women in leadership roles giving a strong and powerful voice to their needs and concerns
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Women face barriers that exist within themselves</h3> Sometimes, we unconsciously hold ourselves back in many ways. We often lack self-confidence, pulling back when we should be leaning in. We let messages get into our heads and often shrink to let men dominate our spaces. We often cast ourselves down by lowering our expectations of what we can achieve. We see ourselves as not enough. We compromise our career goals to accommodate family; only a few of us push for higher positions.
We should be bold enough to march into our boss’s office and demand what we need. Rather than just engaging in arguments over which gender should come first, we need to prove worthy of the respect we demand. We should tackle these internal obstacles as much as we do the external ones.
“Being confident and believing in your own self-worth is necessary to achieving your potential.” ~ Sheryl Sandberg
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Learn to balance your ambition with your appeal to others</h3> To advance their career, women need to build the right public image. This is like walking on a tightrope. While you can’t be too ambitious so as not to be perceived as rude, you have to be assertive and go for what you want. You can’t be too nice; people will take you too seriously.
Avoid strong and insensitive words, while demanding for your needs. Draw clear boundaries but be nice and accommodating
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Conclusion</h3> More women should dream, and dream bigger. Men should also be encouraged to support women in the home and workforce.
We can reignite the revolution by internalizing the revolution. We are close to a more equal world and with each woman that leans in, we move closer to the ultimate goal of true equalit
Try this
Dream big; do not shrink. Also, always speak up in the face of unfairness. And support your fellow women; only this way will the male gender respect us.s:y. us.”
